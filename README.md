**STEPS**

1) Go and download the latest version of GIT.

2) Go on JetBrains webstorm edition website and download the student version of webstorm for free.(Make sure you give webstorm your Git Hub password or else it won't be able to access your repositories)

3) Now go and make an account on GitHub.

4) Create a repository at the top right page of GitHub.

5) Make the repository public and give it a readme file 

6) Then make the repository on WebStorm and import the repository from GitHub.

7) Create Webstorm files and add the files to GIT.

8) Commit changes you did on the files.

9) Push these changes you put in the local repository to the remote repository where it will be public.



**GLOSSARY**

- **Branch**

A branch is just another version of a repository containing similar structure/code. Usually a branch is used to help “borrow” some specific aspect of a repository. You can work on a branch and then later add merge the branches back into one.
- **Clone**

A clone is essentially a copy of a repository that exists locally on your computer instead of some random server like GitHub. You can connect your clone back to the remote if you want to add changes to the repository and push these changes back.
- **Commit**

Commit is when you save changes to a project and the repository then saves the file history and changes done and by whom. Usually when you want to debug or look back to how your code went wrong looking at the different commits would help.
- **Fetch**

Fetching is when you want your local repository to be more updated so you “fetch” the changes from the remote repository. This is an important step if you plan on reviewing and adding changes to the main branch of the repository. 
- **GIT**

GIT is a program that helps allow people to work and collaborate together on projects by tracking different changes in repositories.
- **Github**

GitHub is the website that implements GIT to help users to work and collaborate together on repositories so that they can keep track of different versions and changes.
- **Merge**

Merging is done within the same repository when you want to include the changes in one branch into the other.
- **Merge Conflict**

A merge conflict is just like the name implies, a conflict that happens when you try to merge the branches together. Usually this happens when one branch is too “different” and/or when there are different changes present in the same parts of the file in both branches.
- **Push**

Pushing happens when you want to send over the changes you have committed in your local repository to the remote repository. From there everyone with access to the repository through the server will be able to see the changes.
- **Pull**

Pull is very similar to fetch where it requests the changes committed in the remote repository but it also merges your local repository with that of the remote repository.
- **Remote**

A remote is a version of a repository and/or branch that is hosted on another server. You can access it similar to a repository and it can be synced so that the remote can almost be an identical version save the different edits that were added by another user.
- **Repository**

A repository is like a virtual folder that contains all of a project’s files, editing history, and documentation. It is a basic element in GitHub and people can collaborate together and work on the same repository at the same time.
